# teach about the print function

message = "Hello World"     # this creates a string!

# want to print it twice?
print(message,message)      # note that the comma automatically inserts a space!

# but, how about twice without a space?
print(message+message)      # use the + to concatenate strings

# want to add another carriage return?
print(message, "\n")
print(message)
